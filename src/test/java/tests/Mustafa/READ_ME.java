    Dear Team Members,

    My user stories are complete with exceptions. Briefly;

    US_08 works fine. I reported the bug(!) in the Excel file.
    US_24 works till the end where payment is done by the credit card.
          After successful payment, Chrome's bubble message appears: Save Card?.
          I don't know how to close that prompt and continue. I need to get the toast message to finalise the test.
    US_25 was working fine. Now the assertion doesn't work. Locators are pain in the neck!
    US_29 works fine.

    Thank you all so much for your support.
